## My process

Since I am learning both React and TailwindCSS, I decided to complete this challenge with both of these technologies.

Even though this could have been done simply with HTML/SCSS/JS, I wanted to challenge myself a little bit more by practicing using React Hooks (useState).

I sketched out a diagram on a notebook which assisted in the styling and functionality of the application. After I was confident in my diagram:

- I began by setting up the repository on github.
- Initializing the application with create-react-app and installing TailwindCSS via npm.
- Once the project was configured 100%, I then pushed the code to github for initial commit.
- I proceeded to build the Components (App, Rating, Thankyou) with JSX.
- After the structure was implemented, I styled the Rating component first, followed by the Thankyou component next.
- Once the styling was completed, I implemented the state for both components.
- I then implemented RWD to the best of my ability with my knowledge of TailwindCSS.
- Once complete, I pushed all code to host on Vercel.

### Built with

- Tailwind CSS
- Flexbox
- Mobile-first workflow
- [React](https://reactjs.org/) - JS library

### What I learned

First project with TailwindCSS and React. I learned a lot of the initial setup, configurations, and use of Tailwind while implementing my current knowledge of React to include state management using React Hooks (useState).

One of the biggest learning curves was getting acquainted with using TailwindCSS and how to manuever around the project and the mess of the inline styles. Although a "messy" environment, using my own custom CSS with @apply to help with reusability on similar elements, helped to keep inline styling to a minimum.

### Continued development

This project showed me the need to continue working with the foundations of React, state implementations, and best practices with React and TailwindCSS.

### Useful resources

- [TailwindCSS Documentation](https://tailwindcss.com/) - This helped me for XYZ reason. I really liked this pattern and will use it going forward.
- [React Documentation](https://reactjs.org/docs/getting-started.html) - This is an amazing article which helped me finally understand XYZ. I'd recommend it to anyone still learning this concept.
